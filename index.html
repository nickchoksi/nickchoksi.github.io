 I'm a finishing graduate student and NSF Fellow at UC Berkeley. In Fall 2025, I'll be starting as a 51 Pegasi b fellow at Caltech. For my PhD, I worked with <a href="https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~echiang/">Eugene Chiang</a> at Berkeley on problems in planetary astrophysics. I also received my undergraduate degrees in physics and astrophysics from Berkeley in 2019. As an undergrad I mostly worked with <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ognedin/index.html">Oleg Gnedin</a> on modeling the formation of stellar clusters across cosmic time. <br><br><br>

 I grew up in the suburbs of southeastern Michigan before I ran away from the cold and moved to Berkeley. In my free time, I play tennis, dabble in the nerd grab bag of books and television, and play with my dog, Hank.
